# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Prepared the Microsoft AppSource / Partner Center submission.
- Corrected `pbiviz.json` submission metadata: real support mailbox, `https://atlyn.io/contact`
  support URL, and listing-quality description. The visual GUID is unchanged.
- Replaced the 1x1 placeholder `assets/icon.png` with a real 20x20 cohort-retention icon and
  added the required 300x300 `assets/partner-center-logo-300.png`, both generated
  deterministically by `npm run brand:assets`.
- Added three real 1366x768 submission screenshots captured from the built visual by
  `npm run screenshots`, rendered against deterministic fully offline fixtures.
- Added `EULA.md` and `docs/partner-center-submission.md`.
- Turned the publication readiness script into an enforced gate in both `npm run package`
  and CI, and extended the certification audit and packaging tests to validate the assets
  and submission fields deterministically.

**The packaged `.pbiviz` hash changed.** `assets/icon.png` and `pbiviz.json` are packaged
inputs, so replacing the placeholder icon and correcting the metadata produced a new
artifact. The release manifest and the published artifact must be re-published.

## 1.0.0

- Added the explicit Atlyn Cohort Retention matrix contract.
- Preserved blank, missing, future, observed-zero, and invalid observation states.
- Added nested matrix identities, host interactions, accessibility, localization, and bounded rendering.
